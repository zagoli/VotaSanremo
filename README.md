# VotaSanremo
Code for [votasanremo.zagoli.com](votasanremo.zagoli.com).

This website allows you to vote for each artist every evening during the 
[Sanremo Music Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanremo_Music_Festival) and view a live leaderboard.

It's a personal project, not affiliated with the Festival in any way. 
I created it for my friends and to learn Elixir and Phoenix LiveView. 
Unfortunately, my UI/UX skills are lacking, so it might not look very polished.

# Run locally
1. Install [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html)
2. Install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
3. Clone `main` and cd in project directory
4. Run `mix ecto.setup`
5. Start the server with `mix phx.server`
